description: "Even after graduating, due to my keen interest in multimodal feedbacks and automobile technologies; I continued researching on different technologies and explored numerous research papers which resulted in me working on this research project under the guidance of Dr. Mangesh Bedekar.
Driving an automobile taxes the driver in almost all of his sensory systems and uses his deduction power to the fullest. The mental state of the driver is vital to safe and correct driving. This project focuses on identifying the emotional state of the driver based on his interactions with the automobile while driving and inferring when the driver is in an unpleasant state of mind."
